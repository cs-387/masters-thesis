#Sliding-window: 4:15: trimming when the average quality over 4 bases falls below a threshold of 15 
#Leading and trailing: 5 – historically Illumina created reads with one or 2 N-base-calls at the start and a set of trailing B phred quality score at the end. N’s are treated as quality 0 and #B’s as 2 so by trimming both ends for 5 these artefacts are #removed
#Minimum read length: 75
