The North Atlantic Ocean is home to the common bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus. These dolphins exist in two major geographic regions: the eastern and western regions, and two ecotypes: pelagic and coastal. Recent studies have aimed to pinpoint the demographic history of these Northern Atlantic populations through studies of population genetics (Louis et al, 2021). This study aimed to map the demographic history of common bottlenose dolphins in the North Atlantic through use of newly improved bioinformatic methods. This project used re-sequenced genetic data from 37 individuals to simulate four different possible demographic scenarios. The outcome of these four simulations were then compared to evaluate which model most closely resembled the re-sequenced data.
